**About the company**

Cyclistic is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

**Business Task**:

The business problem is converting casual riders into annual riders: annual riders pay an annual membership fee. My analysis is supposed to understand how the two different categories of users (annual riders and casual riders) use Cyclistic bikes. The insights extracted from this data is used to design a new marketing strategy that would convert casual riders to annual riders.

**Questions my analysis answers**:
- How do annual members and casual riders differ?
- Why would casual riders want an annual membership?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
